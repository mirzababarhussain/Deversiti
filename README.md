## About Deversiti APP Setup

A basic application with Laravel where we have two type of users (Admin, Regular Users). The application will display a list of products. The Admins will be responsible for adding more users or managing their authorities based on their roles. For example an Admin can give authority to a User having role "Manager" to add or modify the products but cannot delete, or Admin can authorize users having role "Cashier" to only view the products and cannot perform anything else:

- Download Project.
